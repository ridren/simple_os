im generally satisfied with how this turned out
although i massively underestimated how much work certain parts do take and i havent even touched any more advanced topics

mistakes:
	macros
		lack standard, complete mess, often broke video specific code because i forgot that macros modify certain registers
	keyboard
		should have been more abstracted
		buffer shouldnt be part of implementation


yup, `not finished, interface still may change` was me handwaving documentation
